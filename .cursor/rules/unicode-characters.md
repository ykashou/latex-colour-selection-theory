LaTeX doesn't handle Unicode special characters reliably. Use LaTeX commands instead.

Common replacements:
- ° → `^\circ` (degree symbol in math mode)
- ′ → `^\prime` (prime symbol in math mode)
- λ → `\wavelength` or `\lambda`
- Δ → `\Delta`
- ∈ → `\in`

This ensures compatibility with all LaTeX engines and prevents compilation errors.
